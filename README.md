This is the official code repository for the paper "DEALT: LLM-driven Diversity-Enhanced Data Augmentation for Long-Tail Text Classification", which has been accepted by AAAI 2026. As I have been extremely busy recently, I promise to sort out and upload the code within one month after the paper is published (expected to be between April and May 2026).
